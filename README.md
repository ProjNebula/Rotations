# Project Nebula Rotations
This repository stores map rotations for the servers on Nebula. Each file listed under the "servers" directory corresponds to a server on Nebula and contains the sequence of maps for that server.

## Suggesting Rotation Changes
Community members may propose rotation changes using our [Discord in the #suggestions channel.](https://discord.gg/kgWvJGKkt8)

When proposing changes, please keep in mind that all changes should be detailed in the post, and make sure that they are consistent with the servers' allowed gamemodes.

Keep in mind that we currently only support DTM, CTW, & TDM.

New servers/gamemodes are not to be suggested here for proposed gamemode rotations. Instead, use the Discord for your ideas.
